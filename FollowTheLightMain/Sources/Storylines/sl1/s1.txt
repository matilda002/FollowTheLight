In the dark, you find matches. 
Lighting one reveals a cave with paths on your right and left. 

Where to? Right or left? 

Your story starts with a spark in the shadows and you feel fear creeping up..

A) You go right. Maybe there’s something interesting there.
B) You go left. Maybe there’s a way out there.
C) You stay where you are. Maybe someone will find you there.
D) You light the whole box of matches. Maybe you’ll see better.
