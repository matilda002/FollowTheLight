Reaching the new surface you see withered skulls around you. 
There is a creepy altar with 3 candles in the middle of it,
two are already lit whilst one is unlit.

Choose wisely...

A) You light the candle. Maybe you’ll show respect and get a reward.
B) You blow out the candles. Something might unfold.
C) You take the unlit candle. Maybe you’ll need it later and get some light.
D) You ignore the candle. Maybe you’ll avoid trouble.
