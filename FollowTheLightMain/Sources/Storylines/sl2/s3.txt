You spot a giant spider sitting on a web, 
it looks dangerous with the skeletons hanging around it. 

What’s your move? 

Choose wisely as the story continues.

A) You scratch its leg. Maybe it will like it and let you pass. 
B) You throw a rock at it. Maybe it will get scared and go away.
C) You talk to it. Maybe it will understand you and help you. 
D) You avoid it. There might be another way around it.
