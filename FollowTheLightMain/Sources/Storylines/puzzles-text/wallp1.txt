When reaching the new surface you see a wall with glowing letters. 

It looks like it can spell out a word, what is it? 

Next to the symbols there's an engraving saying:

"An answer is clear as the light,
 The real answer is not in sight.
 To unravel the mystery that hides,
 Contact the other side where truth abides"
