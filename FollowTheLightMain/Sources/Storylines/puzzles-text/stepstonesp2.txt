You step into an open space with a pool of water, 
and some sort stepping stones with symbols on them. 
It looks like different paths leading to the other side.

While trying to look around for clues on where to step, you have no luck...

The only thing is a note on the ground saying:

"Three digits aligned, a cause for alarm,
Not a charm, but often causing harm.
In superstitions, I wear the devil's cloak,
What am I, a number some invoke?"

Maybe it's best to contact the other person and tell them what you see.
You never know what or who is lurking in the water...
