Seeing the creature was fearful, 
but you stand back up and keep going. 
After a short while you're met by a dragon holding a sign. 

The sign says:

"Enter the secret word" with only three letters written. 

The dragon finally speaks:

"Unlock the secret, with these three letters I hide.
 This may be a guide for the other side.
 Contact them, where your answers reside."
