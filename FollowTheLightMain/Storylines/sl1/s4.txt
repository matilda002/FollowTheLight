Deeper in the damp dungeon you now face a towering wall that looms over you. 
You notice the wall is coated with a slimy substance leaking out from some cracks. Seems like there are some symbols further up the wall, they glow with a sinister light and whisper dark secrets.
What’s your choice?

A) You take the ladder with missing steps. Maybe you’ll find a way to balance and reach the top.
B) You climb the rope. You know that you have enough strength and stamina to pull yourself up.
C) You climb the slippery wall. Maybe you’ll find some cracks and crevices to grip and avoid falling.
D) You look around for another way. Maybe you’ll discover a hidden passage or a secret door.
