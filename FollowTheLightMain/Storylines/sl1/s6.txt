In the passage you notice a tall figure’s shadow now approaching you. You can hear its heavy footsteps and ragged breathing. 
It reeks and you smell its rotten flesh and blood from afar. You can sense its hunger and malice.

A) You step aside and stand still. Maybe it won’t notice you.
B) You run past it. Maybe you can escape it.
C) You fight back. Maybe you can defeat it. 
D) You chicken out and go back to where the stones collapsed.
