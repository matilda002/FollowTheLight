After the spider let's you pass you're met by a dragon holding a sign. The sign says "Enter the secret word" with only 
three letters written. You're confused on what this intels, why are there only three letters?
The dragon finally speaks and says:

"Unlock the secret, with these three letters I hide.
 This may be a guide for the other side.
 Contact them, where your answers reside."
