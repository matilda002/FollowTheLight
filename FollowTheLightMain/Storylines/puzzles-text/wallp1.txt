You maneged to reach the top and you notice a wall with glowing symbols. The letters looks like it spells out a word,
what is the word? Next to the symbols there's an engraving saying:

"An answer is clear as the light,
 The real answer is not in sight.
 To unravel the mystery that hides,
 Contact the other side where truth abides"
