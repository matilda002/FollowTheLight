You step inside an open space, with no direction but to go forward. In the distance you see a light and when you arrive 
it's candle sitting in blood on a table. The light reveals some carved in symbols in a line, what does this mean?
Next to the table there's a stone blocking your way, looks like some sort of path behind it. 
On closer inspection there is a message on it:

"With this blood, write the number on the wall,
You won't find it here, maybe make a call."
